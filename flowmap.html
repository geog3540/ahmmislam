            The main interactive map can be observed using this link- <a href = "projectfile.json">Project File</a>.
            You can import the file to <a href ="https://flowmapper.org/">flowmapper website</a>.
            Flow mapper is a web application to develop flow maps and this application is developed by <a href = "https://www.geo-social.com/">Geo-Social Lab</a>.<br>
            <br>
            <br> Flow line: I used curve with half arrow for my flow map. Such lines can reduce the overlapping of flow lines at the origin and destination locations by tapering the flow lines to thin points at the extremities. The purpose of using curved paths is to enhance readability for the users as the lines are symmetric and maintain directions in two-way flow maps. That’s why it’s a good fit for explaining phenomena like migration where people move from one place to another place. I used migration flows for the arrows using proportional classification. It provides the thickness of the flows which is proportional to the values of volumes. Such way it can maintain the real scenario of the migration from state to state. I chose the colors based on contrast of choropleth and node colors to avoid any conflict between the colors. The color schemes are colorblind safe. Besides, using my color scheme I found a significant flow for Texas which is highly different that other flows. Hence, the color scheme I used (greys) provides a good scope for explaining the flows without looking at the legend. It’s beneficial for the readers. I used top 75 flows to avoid too much visible flows on the map. I also tried 100 but in that case the map looks crowded.
            <br>
            Nodes: I used total flow between 1887 to 1924 to map the nodes. I wanted to show a relationship between the in-flow migrant families based on the total between 1887 to 1924. I used quantile classification to classify the total flows as my intention is to focus on highest (top 25%) and lowest (least 25%) states with total migration and correlate with the same classes with in-flow values. As I used top 75 flows, it removed some of the states with least total flows but provides a better visualization for the top 25% or 50% total flows. I used yellow-green-blue color schemes to show the intensity of total flows. Blue shows the highest quantile of flows while the yellow shows the least quantile.
            <br>
            Regions: I showed the in-flows of the migrant families through choropleth region mapping and used schemes of red to visualize it. The most reddish areas are the states with high in flow of migrants while the faded reddish areas are the states with least in flow of the migrants. In this way, it’s easier to understand which states are most favorite by the migrants to migrate. I used quantile classification methods to focus on the states with most in-flow of migration.
            <br>
            Spatial pattern: There are interesting patterns can be seen from this map. Based on the flows, Texas looks like the state with more flows. There’s a high flow to Oklahoma from Texas and also from Oklahoma to Texas. Increasing number of jobs or number of international populations might be the reasons behind this flow movements. Hence, Texas is the state with most send flow. On the other hand, there are many states with least flows specially the states eastern states and western states show low send flow. Overall, the midwestern and the southern states are more active in migrations than the west and northeast states. And the pattern is also visible when compare with inflows. The midwestern and the south states show maximum inflows. The nodes in these states are blue means total flow of migration is also high in these areas. Everything is logically connected (migration flow, total flow, and inflow) and make sense using flow mapping visualization.
